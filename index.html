        <h2>What’s covered in these terms</h2><br><br>
            <h4>We know it’s tempting to skip these Terms of Service, but it’s important to establish what you can expect from us as you use The Pixels services, and what we expect from you.</h4><br><br>

            <p>
                We want to maintain a respectful environment for everyone, which means that you must follow these basic rules of conduct:
comply with applicable laws, including export control, sanctions, money laundering and human trafficking laws
respect the rights of others, including privacy and intellectual property rights
don’t abuse or harm others or yourself (or threaten or encourage such abuse or harm) including against children – for example, by misleading, defrauding, illegally impersonating, defaming, bullying, harassing or stalking others; hosting or publishing any obscene content or inciting the breach of applicable laws
don’t abuse, harm, interfere with, or disrupt the services – for example, by accessing or using them in fraudulent or deceptive ways, introducing malware or spamming, hacking or bypassing our systems or protective measures. When we index the web to bring you search results, we respect standard usage restrictions that website owners specify in their websites’ code, so we require the same when others use our services
Our service-specific additional terms and policies provide additional details about appropriate conduct that everyone using those services must follow. If you find that others aren’t following these rules, many of our services allow you to report abuse. If we act on a report of abuse, we also provide the process described in the Taking action in case of problems section.
